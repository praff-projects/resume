## Coding Standards

### File Organization
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Header.tsx      # Personal info, contact details, links
│   ├── Experience.tsx  # Professional work history (game levels)
│   ├── Education.tsx   # Academic background
│   └── Skills.tsx      # Technical skills (power-ups)
├── App.tsx            # Main application with resume data
├── App.css            # Responsive and print-friendly styles
└── main.tsx           # Application entry point
```

### CSS Guidelines
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
- Maintain mobile-first responsive design approach
- Preserve print styles for PDF generation capability
- Keep animations performant with `transform` and `opacity`
- Use semantic class names that reflect both game theme and professional content

### TypeScript Guidelines
- Maintain strict type checking
- Use interfaces for data structures (resume data, game state)
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and reusable

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize fonts and assets for fast loading
- Use CSS animations over JavaScript where possible
- Implement lazy loading for heavy game assets if needed
- Maintain Lighthouse scores above 90 for all metrics

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # Start development server on localhost:5173
pnpm build        # Build for production
pnpm lint         # Run ESLint
pnpm preview      # Preview production build
```

### Deployment
- Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages on push to `main` branch
- GitHub Actions workflow handles build, lint, and deployment
- Preview URL: https://praff-projects.github.io/resume/

## Important Notes

### Accessibility
- Maintain keyboard navigation support
- Ensure sufficient color contrast despite retro theme
- Provide alt text for game graphics
- Keep screen reader compatibility

### Browser Support
- Support modern evergreen browsers
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Mobile-first responsive design

### PR Guidelines
- Always include the preview URL in PR descriptions: https://praff-projects.github.io/resume/
- Test changes across devices and browsers
- Verify print styles still work correctly
- Run linting and build checks before commits

### Game Theme Balance
- Keep professional content easily readable
- Ensure game theme enhances rather than obscures information
- Maintain option to view in "classic" resume format if needed
- Balance creativity with professionalism

## Common Patterns

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface WorkExperience {
  company: string;
  position: string;
  duration: string;
  location: string;
  achievements: string[];
  // Game theme properties
  level?: number;
  difficulty?: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
  technologies?: string[];
}
```

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: `max-width: 768px`
- Tablet: `768px - 1024px`
- Desktop: `min-width: 1024px`
- Print: `@media print`

### Animation Principles
- Use `ease-out` for entrances
- Use `ease-in` for exits
- Keep duration under 300ms for UI interactions
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` settings

Remember: The goal is to create a memorable, interactive experience that showcases technical creativity while maintaining professionalism and readability of the resume content.
